Chapter 1.  Vectors
-------------------

=== Testing Code Stuff


==== First line of code problem

[source,java]
----
PVector velocity = new PVector(random(-0.05,0.05),random(-0.05,0.05));
int x = 0;
----

vs. with a second line

[source,java]
----
int x = 0;
PVector velocity = new PVector(random(-0.05,0.05),random(-0.05,0.05));
----

Also notice how there is extra space between first line and second line

[source,java]
----
int x = 0;
int y = 100;
int z = 500;
int a = 50;
----
