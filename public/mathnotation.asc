=== 1.3 Vector Addition

Before we continue looking at the [klass]*PVector* class and its [function]*add()* method (purely for the sake of learning since it’s already implemented for us in Processing itself), let’s examine vector addition using the notation found in math and physics textbooks

Vectors are typically written either in boldface type or with an arrow on top.  For the purposes of this book, to distinguish a *_vector_* from a *scalar* (scalar refers to a single value, such as an integer or a floating point number), we’ll use the arrow notation:

- Vector: `<math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><mstyle displaystyle="true"><mover><mrow><mi>u</mi></mrow><mrow><mo>&#x2192;<!--rightwards arrow--></mo></mrow></mover></mstyle></math>`
- Scalar: [var]*x*

Let’s say I have the following two vectors:

Each vector has two components, an x and a y.  To add two vectors together we simply add both x’s and both y’s.

In other words:

[vector]*w* = [vector]*u* + [vector]*v*

translates to:

[var]*w*~x~ = [var]*u~x~* + [var]*v~x~* +
[var]*w*~y~ = [var]*u~y~* + [var]*v~y~*

and therefore:

[var]*w*~x~ =  5 + 3 +
[var]*w*~y~ =  2 + 4

and therefore:

[vector]*w* =  (8,6)

[notetoself]*[Math Notation]*

Now that we understand how to add two vectors together, we can look at how addition is implemented in the [klass]*PVector* class itself.  Let’s write a function called [function]*add()* that takes as its argument another [klass]*PVector* object.
