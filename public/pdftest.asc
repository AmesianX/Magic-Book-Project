Chapter 2.  Forces

In the final example of Chapter 1, we saw how we could calculate a dynamic acceleration based on a vector pointing from a circle on the screen to the mouse location.   The resulting motion resembled a magnetic attraction between circle and mouse, as if some _force_ were pulling the circle in towards the mouse.  In this chapter we will formalize our understanding of the concept of a *_force_* and its relationship to *_acceleration_*.    Our goal, by the end of this chapter, is to understand how to make multiple objects move around the screen and respond to a variety of environmental forces.
